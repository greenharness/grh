# Changelog

What an upgrader gets, in sentences. The release workflow refuses a tag whose
section is missing here.

## v0.1.0

### Added

- **`grh install <part|profile>…`** installs any subset of the Green Harness
  parts (decisions, gate, guardrails, router, conform, attest, workflow) and
  the profiles solo, team and full, with what each part needs. It runs each
  tool's own install command, places the published skills and agents, adopts
  what is already installed, and arms a repository only with `--repo`.
- **`grh uninstall [part…]`** removes exactly what grh placed, through the
  tool that placed it, and never what it adopted.
- **`grh audit`** reads a repository and recommends parts and a profile.
- **`grh status`**, and **`grh <part> …`**, which runs the part's own command.
- **Extensions** (`greenharness.toml`, `docs/extension-manifest.md`) and
  `grh install --extension <dir>`.
